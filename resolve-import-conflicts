# This script edits files in place to resolve conflict markers related to Java imports.
# It leaves other conflict markers untouched.
# Usage:
#   resolve-import-conflicts [file ...]
#
# The script works on all files given on the command line.
# If none are given, the script works on all files in or under the current directory.
#
# The status code is 0 (success) if all conflicts are resolved.
# The status code is 1 (failure) if any conflict remains.

# This is not a git mergetool.  A git mergetool is given the base, parent 1, and
# parent 2 files, all without conflict markers.
# However, this can be run after a git mergetool that leaves conflict
# markers in files, as the default git mergetool does.
