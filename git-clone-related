# git-clone-related:  clones a repository that is related to this one,
#   or pulls it if it has already been cloned.
#
# Sometimes, two repositories are related:  you need clones of both of them.
# When run from a clone of one (possibly in a fork and/or on a branch), this
# clones the other, attempting to find a matching fork and branch.
# This script also works in an Azure Pipelines, CircleCI, or Travis CI job.
#
# Usage:  git-clone-related [--debug] UPSTREAM_ORG REPO_NAME [DESTINATION] [GIT_CLONE_ARGS...]
#   UPSTREAM_ORG is, if this is a fork, the parent organization.
#   REPO_NAME is the repository name without the organization.
#   DESTINATION is the new clone (not its parent), by default ../REPO_NAME .
#     If it exists, it is updated via "git pull", without changing its fork
#     or branch.  No error is issued if the pull fails.
#   GIT_CLONE_ARGS is extra arguments to git clone.  It defaults to
#     "-q --single-branch --depth 1" (without the quotes).
#     It is not used if the destination already exists.
#
# When invoked from within a clone of MYORG/MYREPO, at branch MYBRANCH,
# this script chooses the first of these that exists:
#   branch ${MYBRANCH} of https://github.com/${MYORG}/${REPO_NAME}.git
#   branch ${MYBRANCH} of https://github.com/${UPSTREAM_ORG}/${REPO_NAME}.git
#   branch master of https://github.com/${UPSTREAM_ORG}/${REPO_NAME}.git
#
# Requires the `jq` program to be installed, when used in Azure Pipelines jobs.

# Fail if any command fails.
